ldesc: "This program, given a source file, produces a document with 
syntax highlighting. Source-highlight reads source language 
specifications dynamically, thus it can be easily extended for handling 
new languages. It also reads output format specifications dynamically, 
and thus it can be easily extended for handling new output formats."
